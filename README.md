# The Ready App

A notification messaging platform mobile application for android (currently) allowing businesses and entrepreneurs to notify a user when a product/service is complete or ready.

Sellers will anonymously be able to do business with a seller without having a feeling if the user will be side tracked and buy from another seller.

Buyers will be able to notify the buyer of a product/service he/her desire,
and seller will notify the buyer when that service/product is complete or ready.


> ***NOTE***: This project is merely to demostrate skills and deducation. I'm willing to take this product as far as I can.
